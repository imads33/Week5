Create a class called Person with attributes name and age. Create a subclass called Employee that inherits from Person and adds attributes salary and position. Create two subclasses, Manager and Engineer, that both inherit from Employee. Add an attribute num_reports to Manager and an attribute specialization to Engineer. Create a method in Manager called hire_employee() that increments the num_reports attribute. Create a method in Engineer called solve_problem() that prints out "Problem solved!".
